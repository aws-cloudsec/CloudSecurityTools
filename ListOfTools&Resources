The tool performs tests to simulate DNS tunneling, DGA traffic, requests to known active C2 destinations, and other suspicious traffic patterns.
https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim/blob/master/README.md

27. Suricata: https://suricata.io/ - Suricata is a high performance, open source network analysis and threat detection software used by most private and public organizations, and embedded by major vendors to protect their assets.
28. Amazon GuardDuty Tester by AWS
29. RED TEAM TOOL: Amazon GuardDuty Tester- https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-guardduty-tester Amazon GuardDuty Tester is helpful to trigger GuardDuty findings. However, it is tightly coupled with GuardDuty and is a product-specific tool, even within the AWS ecosystem. If GuardDuty doesn't detect an attack technique, you won't find it in here.
30. RED TEAM TOOL: AWS CloudSaga (awslabs) https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudsaga AWS CloudSaga has a few simulation scenarios (five at the time of writing). Some of them are more focused around identifying vulnerable resources in your account (such as imds_reveal listing your EC2 instances without IMDSv2 enforced), while others are designed to simulate attacker behavior. The attacker behavior implemented by AWS Cloud Saga emulates several stages of the attack lifecycle, while Stratus Red Team purposely attempts to stay as granular as possible (see: Philosophy). As much as possible, Stratus Red Team techniques also reference real-world incidents or breaches.
