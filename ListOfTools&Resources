26. Flightism: https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim - flightsim is a lightweight utility used to generate malicious network traffic and help security teams to evaluate security controls and network visibility. The tool performs tests to simulate DNS tunneling, DGA traffic, requests to known active C2 destinations, and other suspicious traffic patterns.

28. Amazon GuardDuty Tester by AWS
29. ED TEAM TOOL: Amazon GuardDuty Tester- https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-guardduty-tester Amazon GuardDuty Tester is helpful to trigger GuardDuty findings. However, it is tightly coupled with GuardDuty and is a product-specific tool, even within the AWS ecosystem. If GuardDuty doesn't detect an attack technique, you won't find it in here.
30. ED TEAM TOOL: AWS CloudSaga (awslabs) https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudsaga AWS CloudSaga has a few simulation scenarios (five at the time of writing). Some of them are more focused around identifying vulnerable resources in your account (such as imds_reveal listing your EC2 instances without IMDSv2 enforced), while others are designed to simulate attacker behavior. The attacker behavior implemented by AWS Cloud Saga emulates several stages of the attack lifecycle, while Stratus Red Team purposely attempts to stay as granular as possible (see: Philosophy). As much as possible, Stratus Red Team techniques also reference real-world incidents or breaches.

51. tenable/EscalateGPT https://github.com/tenable/EscalateGPT An AI-powered tool for discovering privilege escalation opportunities in AWS IAM configurations, by Tenable. “In our testing against real-world AWS environments, we found that GPT4 managed to identify complex scenarios of privilege escalation based on non-trivial policies through multi-IAM accounts.”
53. tenable/Burp-extension-for-GPT A Burp Suite extension that leverages OpenAI to analyze HTTP traffic and identify potential security concerns. “We tested some real-world scenarios and we found that GPT3.5 and GPT4 successfully identified XSS and misconfigured HTTP headers without requiring any additional fine-tuning.”
